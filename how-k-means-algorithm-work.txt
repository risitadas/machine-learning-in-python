how does K-Means Algorithm work?


step-1: select the number K to decide the number of clusters

step-2: select random K points or centroids, it can be other from the input dataset

step-3: assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters

step-4: calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster

step-5: repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster

step-6: if any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH

step-7: the model is ready
