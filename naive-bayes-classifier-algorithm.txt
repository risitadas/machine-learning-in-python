Naïve Bayes Classifier :


applications :

1. used for credit scoring
2. used in medical data classification
3. used in real-time predictions 
	because Naïve Bayes Classifier is an eager learner
4. used in text classification such as spam filtering and sediment analysis



advantages :

1. fast and easy ML algorithm to predict a class of dataset
2. can be used for binary and as well as multi-class classifications
3. performs well in multi-class predictions as compared to others
4. most popular choice for text classification problems



disadvantages :

1. it assumes that all features are independent or unrelated,
	so it cannot learn the relationship between the features



types :

1. Gaussian --> Gaussian model assumes that features follow a normal distribution, this means if predictors take continuous values instead of discrete, 
			then the model assumes that these values are sampled from the Gaussian distribution

2. Multinomial --> Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier is used when the data is multinomial distributed, it is primarily used for document classification problems, 
			it means a particular document belongs to which category such as Sports, Politics, education, etc.
				the classifier uses the frequency of words for the predictors

3. Bernoulli --> Bernoulli classifier works similar to the Multinomial classifier, but the predictor variables are the independent Booleans variables,
			such as if a particular word is present or not in a document,
				this model is also famous for document classification tasks



python implementation :

1. data preprocessing step

2. fitting Naive Bayes to the training set step

3. predicting the test result step

4. test accuracy of the result(creation of confusion matrix) step

5. visualizing the test set result step
