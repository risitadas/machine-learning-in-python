Different Combinations of Bias-Variance :



1. low bias, low variance -->  shows an ideal machine learning model, it is not possible practically



2. low bias , high variance -->   model predictions are inconsistent and accurate on average, 
						occurs when the model learns with a large number of parameters and hence leads to an overfitting



3. high bias, low variance -->   predictions are consistent but inaccurate on average,
						occurs when a model does not learn well with the training dataset or uses few numbers of the parameter,
						it leads to underfitting problems in the model



4. high bias, high variance --> predictions are inconsistent and also inaccurate on average
