Elbow Method


--> the Elbow method is one of the most popular ways to find the optimal number of clusters

--> this method uses the concept of WCSS value

--> WCSS stands for Within Cluster Sum of Squares, which defines the total variations within a cluster

--> the formula to calculate the value of WCSS (for 3 clusters) is given below:

		
		WCSS= ∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2 +∑Pi in Cluster2distance(Pi C2)2+∑Pi in CLuster3 distance(Pi C3)2


--> in the above formula of WCSS,

		∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2: it is the sum of the square of the distances between each data point 
			and its centroid within a cluster1 and the same for the other two terms


--> to measure the distance between data points and centroid, we use any method such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance


--> to find the optimal value of clusters, the elbow method follows the below steps:

	1. it executes the K-means clustering on a given dataset for different K values (ranges from 1-10)
	2. for each value of K, calculates the WCSS value
	3. plots a curve between calculated WCSS values and the number of clusters K
	4. the sharp point of bend or a point of the plot looks like an arm, then that point is considered as the best value of K
