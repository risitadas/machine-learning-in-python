Ways of reducing High Bias and High Variance :

I.  ways to reduce high bias ?

	--> increase the input features as the model is underfittied
	--> decrease the regulariztion term
	--> using more complex models, such as including some polynomial features


II.  ways to reduce high variance ?

	--> reducing the input features or number of parameters as a model is overfitted
	--> not using such a complex model
	--> increase the training data
	--> increase the regularization term
