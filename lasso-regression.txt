Lasso Regression 


meaning :

LASSO = Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator



what is lasso regression :

is a regularization technique
it is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction
this model uses shrinkage

shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean
the lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters)
this particular type of regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of multicollinearity or when we want to automate certain parts of model selection, 
		like variable selection/parameter elimination

it uses L1 regularization technique
it is used when we have more features because it automatically performs feature selection
